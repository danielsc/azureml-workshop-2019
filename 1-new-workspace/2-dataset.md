# Datasets and Datastores

The AzureML studio allows the user to manage their dataset and datastores directly inside the portal. 

A Dataset is a resource for exploring, transforming and managing data in Azure Machine Learning. 
Datasets enable:

- Easy access to data: without worrying about connection strings or data paths. Only keep a single copy of data in the storage service of your choice.

- Training with big data: seamless integration with Azure Machine Learning features like labelling, training products and pipelines. Users can share and reuse datasets in various experiments.

- Tracking data usage: Azure ML automatically tracks which version of the dataset was used for the ML experiment and produced which model.


## Uploading a Dataset to AzureML studio

1. Download the IBM Attrition dataset by clicking on this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielsc/azureml-workshop-2019/master/data/IBM-Employee-Attrition.csv and saving the file to disk.

1. Navigate to the left pane of your workspace. Select Datasets under the Assets section.

1. Click on 'Create dataset' and choose 'From local files'. Name the dataset **'IBM-Employee-Attrition'** and then click 'Next'. Make sure to leave the dataset type as Tabular.

1. Click 'Browse', choose the file you had downloaded, and then click 'Next' to create the dataset in the workspace's default Blob storage.
and then click 'Done' to complete the creation of the new dataset. Make sure to leave the Type set to Tabular.

1. Click 'Next' through the following "Settings and preview" and "Schema" sections to verify that everything looks correct.

1. Finally, in the "Confirm Details" section, select "Profile this dataset after creation" and specify the 'cpu-cluster' that you previously created as the compute to use for profiling.

## Generating a Profile

1. Now, click on the newly created dataset and click 'Explore'. Here you can see the fields of the Tabular dataset.

1. To get more details (in particulare for larger datasets), click 'Generate profile', select the cluster you created and then click 'Generate' to generate profile information for this dataset. This will take little while, since the cluster needs to spin up a node, so we will move to the next task and come back to this later.
